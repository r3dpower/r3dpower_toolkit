# r3dpower_toolkit
A script to install a collection of tools for web application pentesting and bug bounty.
The main purpose of this project is to make an easy and fast installation process for a new PT/BB machine, without the headache of collecting different tools and wordlists everytime.

At the moment, the toolkit includes the installation of following tools and utilities:
  - Programming/Scripting languages: python3, nodejs and go
  - Docker installation
  - Wordlists from Assetnote and Seclists (content discovery, APIs, passwords and subdomains)
  - SQLMap
  - Nmap
  - MySQL Client
  - Amass
  - httpx
  - gau
  - Sublist3r
  - ffuf
  - GoBuster
  - nuclei
  - Postman
  - WPScan
  - GitTools
  - DS_Store dumper
  - TruffleHog
  - Metasploit
This is an open source project so the list continues to grow as contributors will append more useful tools.
